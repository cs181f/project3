# architetural refinement and specification development

* easiest part of the projet
* had what we thought was a very good architecture, so it was pretty easy to extrapolate that to specifications

# development of component designs

* we were unprepared for how much work this was going to be
    - KEY LESSON: do a better job of calibrating *how much work* each thing is going to be and give the ones that are more work more time, even if the suggested schedule blocks them evenly
* slipped because all three of us had major assignments on due the monday after the day this was supposed to be do, so we pushed it back 3 days
* think that this was one of our weaker moments

# development of test plans

* this was a little late because we were waiting on the component designs
* other than delay because of designs, had little trouble with writing these
* looking back, we were not as thorough as we could have been writing these the first time, didn't write tests for fail cases
    - KEY LESSON: never overlook fail cases in test plan

# review process

* this got delayed because of thanksgiving, which was OK--we had plenty of time to get it done in the week after
* think this was probably our must successful part of the project
* very helpful to format our notes in a similar way to final review report
    - allowed meeting to be quick and easy

# resulting design/plan changes

* review was *very* helpful in helping us improve our designs
* got delayed 1 day for no real reason, probably one of our weaker moments of the project
    - KEY LESSON: don't let fatigue at end of project limit productivity/delay milestones
* this delay led to delay of post mortem, causing us to sacrafice twice as many late days as necessary
* overall, very pleased with how changes turned out and with our final designs etc

# planning and ongoing manageament of activities

* as semester started to wind down, became harder and harder to accurately plan and mangage necessary assignments
    - KEY LESSON: reinforces need to not let fatigue at end of semester overwhelm us
* was helpful to have one person (Jesse) manage the plan/server as team leader for the project
    - KEY LESSON: having one person in a leadership role made it so there were less places where the system could break down

# overall thoughts

* none of us had ever created a design/test plan so it was extremely educational to implement them both
* learned a surprising amount about how to manage a team when there were lots of distractions to the team members/other responsibilities
